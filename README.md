## Overview

G-Date is an assignment for class CS-530: Advanced Software Engineering at Central Connecticut State University. The goal of this is to assist in a research experiment in which participants think they are going on a speed date with other men. What they do not know is the other men are all fake accounts with predetermined responses to the questions asked. The hope is that this technology will help researchers find out how men identify potentially dangerous situations when dating in an online world.
